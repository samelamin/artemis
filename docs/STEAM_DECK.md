# Steam Deck setup and validation

This guide is for the development Flatpak with application ID
`com.artemisdesktop.ArtemisDesktopDev`. It is a sideloaded test build, not the
Flathub Moonlight application and not a claim of Steam Deck Verified status.

New users should complete the checksum-verified
[Steam Deck quick start](STEAM_DECK_QUICK_START.md) first. This document begins
where installation ends: host/display matching, streaming quality,
troubleshooting, and real-device evidence.

> **Hardware status:** CI can inspect the package and exercise software-only
> contracts, but it has no Steam Deck GPU, display, controller, or Gamescope
> session. Every item in the [hardware acceptance matrix](#hardware-acceptance-matrix)
> starts **Not run** until somebody records results from a real LCD or OLED
> Deck. The software is ready for Steam Deck testing; unrun hardware rows are
> not implied to pass.

## Installation and update boundary

The [quick start](STEAM_DECK_QUICK_START.md) is the maintained install,
in-app-update, Discover-recovery, and uninstall procedure. It uses the atomic
Flatpak-plus-checksum archive rather than racing two rolling downloads.

The beta remains a single-file bundle, so `flatpak update` cannot discover a
new Vibertemis build by itself. Vibertemis may download and verify an exact
newer release asset, but installation is always explicit: Gaming Mode retains
the verified file, Desktop Mode reverifies it, and Discover or the displayed
manual command asks the user to confirm the update. The app never invokes a
host shell or reports installation success.

The development ID is an established compatibility identifier. It is
intentionally distinct from other applications; do not uninstall another app
to install this bundle.

## Add Vibertemis to Steam

1. In Desktop Mode, launch Steam and choose **Games > Add a Non-Steam Game to
   My Library** ([Valve's instructions][valve-non-steam]).
2. Select **Vibertemis** and add it. Restart Steam once if the newly installed
   desktop entry is not listed yet.
3. Return to Gaming Mode and launch Vibertemis from **Library > Non-Steam**.
4. Open the entry's controller settings and start with a standard gamepad
   template. Confirm D-pad, sticks, `A`/`B`, and the Steam on-screen keyboard
   before pairing or changing settings.

Use the application launcher or `flatpak run` command above in Desktop Mode.
Gaming Mode is the primary Gamescope and OLED HDR test path; Desktop Mode remains
important for installation, logs, and an SDR launch/input check.

Updating the bundle does not change its application ID, so the Steam shortcut
normally does not need to be added again.

## Display and stream matching

Valve specifies a 1280x800 panel capped at 60 Hz for Steam Deck LCD and a
1280x800 HDR panel up to 90 Hz for Steam Deck OLED ([specifications][deck-specs],
[support note][deck-refresh]). Use these as starting points, not evidence that a
particular stream path has passed:

| Use case | SteamOS display mode | Vibertemis stream request | Host target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LCD handheld | 1280x800 at 60 Hz | 1280x800 at 60 FPS | 1280x800 at 60 Hz/FPS |
| OLED handheld, SDR | 1280x800 at 90 Hz | 1280x800 at 90 FPS | 1280x800 at 90 Hz/FPS |
| OLED handheld, HDR | 1280x800 at 90 Hz, HDR enabled | 1280x800 at 90 FPS, HDR enabled | Matching HDR-capable display at 90 Hz/FPS |
| Docked | Select a stable external mode in SteamOS | Exact external resolution and rate | Exact client request |
| 59.94 Hz content/display | 59.94 Hz where SteamOS exposes it | Custom rate `59.94` | Exact 59.94 Hz/FPS, not rounded 59 or 60 |

For a docked display, select its resolution and refresh rate in SteamOS before
starting Vibertemis, then request the same values in Vibertemis and on the host. If the
link is unstable, Valve recommends trying a lower mode and checking the dock,
cable, input, and display capabilities ([docking guide][deck-docking]). Do not
assume that a nominally capable cable supports every HDR/high-refresh mode.

Apollo can create a virtual display from the client's requested resolution and
rate. If automatic matching rounds or selects the wrong mode, configure the
client-specific value in Apollo's PIN page, for example
`1280x800x59.94`, reconnect, and verify the resulting host mode. Apollo documents
this exact fractional override in [Display Mode Override][apollo-display-mode].
Use a host frame limiter only after the client, stream, virtual display, and game
targets agree; Apollo's [stutter guidance][apollo-stutter] explains why a mismatch
can look like network jitter.

### Native Steam Deck display matching

**Match Steam Deck display** is available only on a real Steam Deck in Gaming Mode
while virtual display streaming is enabled. It applies the current Gamescope SDL
display resolution and Qt-reported refresh rate only to that stream's effective
configuration. The saved resolution, refresh, bitrate, codec, and HDR choices are
not changed. Detection failure leaves those saved choices unchanged. LCD and OLED
are not inferred from 90 Hz; the client derives whatever mode is currently active,
including integer or fractional rates represented by Vibertemis's milli-Hz parser.

### Startup readiness and recovery

A successful `/launch` or `/resume` response may contain the RTSP session URL in
`sessionUrl0`, and Vibertemis passes that URL directly to the pinned Moonlight C
client. A plain `/serverinfo` request only proves that the server and its app
metadata are reachable; its state and `currentgame` fields do not prove that the
new virtual-display RTSP session is ready. Vibertemis therefore uses the returned
RTSP URL when available and otherwise retains a bounded, cancellable retry of the
Moonlight RTSP handshake. The original `/launch` or `/resume` request is never
reissued during those retries, which prevents a duplicate host app or session.

There is no reliable client-side suspend/resume or network-restored event that can
safely restart an established connection. If the established session terminates
after Deck sleep or a network interruption, Vibertemis offers **Resume**. Resume
rechecks `/serverinfo` and requires a busy host state reporting the same app ID
before issuing `/resume`; it never issues a second `/launch` or creates a second
host app. A failed recheck returns the user to the existing app list so the app
can be started explicitly. If the process receives no termination callback while
the Deck sleeps, the client cannot detect that state and the same one-tap recovery
path remains the safe boundary.

### Disconnect classification

Four outcomes cover every termination the session can observe:

- **Graceful host termination** — the host sends a normal termination reason
  (`ML_ERROR_GRACEFUL_TERMINATION`, `0`); the app list reappears with no error
  or recovery dialog.
- **Intentional local** — the user pressed Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q, the gamepad quit
  combo (Start+Select+L1+R1), or clicked Disconnect/Quit in the Quick Menu,
  or the recovery dialog was dismissed, or the application is exiting via
  `aboutToQuit`. The session marks itself intentional before pushing
  `SDL_QUIT`, so any subsequent termination callback is classified as
  intentional regardless of the termination code the host happened to echo
  back. No recovery or error dialog is shown.
- **Unexpected mid-stream** — a non-zero termination code arrives after the
  session has started streaming, while the user has not initiated a quit.
  Only this case surfaces the **Resume** dialog.
- **Pre-connection launch failure** — a non-zero termination code arrives
  before the session is marked started. This routes through the legacy
  actionable error dialog; no recovery is offered because the host app
  state cannot be safely resumed.

The classification is unit-tested in `tests/virtualdisplay` as
`disconnect*` and `disconnectOutcomesAreMutuallyExclusiveAndCoverAllInputs`.
Every combination of (errorCode, intentional, started) is exercised so that
recovery and legacy-error dialogs are never both emitted, and each of the
four outcomes above has a dedicated test.

## Vibepollo/Apollo refresh metadata acceptance

> **Current status:** The `maxFPS` and `clientRefreshRateX100` protocol mapping is
> unit-tested. A stream to a real Vibepollo host has not yet been verified, so do
> not describe this as a verified Vibepollo stream path until the checklist below
> is completed and its evidence is recorded.

Capture synchronized client and host logs for each test case. For the fractional
case, set a custom rate of `59.94` Hz. The unit-tested wire mapping is
`maxFPS=59940` and `clientRefreshRateX100=5994`; the whole-FPS boundary clamping
that keeps those fields consistent is also unit-tested.

Vibepollo logs the RTSP request payload and these attributes only at verbose
level. Record the existing host log level, temporarily set
`min_log_level = verbose` in the Vibepollo configuration, and restart or
reconfigure Vibepollo as required by that installation before testing. Capture
the payload lines for `x-nv-video[0].maxFPS` and
`x-nv-video[0].clientRefreshRateX100`. After the tests, restore the previous log
level and restart or reconfigure Vibepollo again. Verbose logs are noisy and may
contain sensitive host, client, application, or network details, so review and
redact them before sharing.

- [ ] Confirm the Vibertemis client log contains `Stream refresh metadata` with the
  expected `maxFPS` and `clientRefreshRateX100` values.
- [ ] Confirm the Vibepollo/Apollo host log reports the same two fields from the
  incoming stream request.
- [ ] Confirm Vibepollo does not emit its `clientRefreshRateX100`/`maxFPS`
  mismatch warning.
- [ ] Start the stream and sustain a moving scene for 10 minutes; confirm the
  effective rate observed by the host and client remains at the requested 59.94
  Hz/FPS, allowing only normal measurement tolerance rather than rounding the
  target to 59 or 60.
- [ ] Repeat with an integer rate such as 60 FPS; confirm both sides report
  `maxFPS=60` and `clientRefreshRateX100=6000`, and the stream starts and remains
  usable.
- [ ] Arrange an invalid persisted custom rate with an integer fallback such as
  60 FPS; confirm both sides receive the matching fallback values `maxFPS=60`
  and `clientRefreshRateX100=6000`, with no mismatch warning, and the stream
  starts normally.

The settings UI rejects invalid custom rates, so reproduce the final case by
temporarily editing the stopped Flatpak's persisted configuration. First stop
the development application and locate its `Artemis.conf` compatibility filename; the organization
subdirectory can vary, so use `find` rather than assuming its exact path:

```bash
flatpak kill com.artemisdesktop.ArtemisDesktopDev 2>/dev/null || true
find "$HOME/.var/app/com.artemisdesktop.ArtemisDesktopDev/config" \
  -type f -name 'Artemis.conf' -print
```

Copy the single path printed by `find` into `ARTEMIS_CONF`, verify it, and make a
backup. If more than one path is printed, identify the file updated by the
current development application instead of guessing.

```bash
ARTEMIS_CONF='/absolute/path/printed/by/find/Artemis.conf'
test -f "$ARTEMIS_CONF"
cp -- "$ARTEMIS_CONF" "$ARTEMIS_CONF.before-vibepollo-test"
kwrite "$ARTEMIS_CONF"
```

In the existing `[General]` section, change or add these keys, save the file,
then relaunch Vibertemis and perform the invalid-fallback checklist item:

```ini
[General]
fractionalrefreshrate=true
customrefreshrate=9
fps=60
```

```bash
flatpak run com.artemisdesktop.ArtemisDesktopDev
```

After capturing the result, stop Vibertemis before restoring the exact backup. The
backup is intentionally retained rather than deleted.

```bash
flatpak kill com.artemisdesktop.ArtemisDesktopDev 2>/dev/null || true
cp -- "$ARTEMIS_CONF.before-vibepollo-test" "$ARTEMIS_CONF"
```

Record the Vibertemis commit, Vibepollo/Apollo version, requested and effective
rates, relevant log excerpts, and stream duration. This client change does not
add Vibepollo runtime bitrate/ABR control, host virtual-display recovery, WGC,
HDR peak control, WebRTC, or server UI features to Vibertemis.

## Codec selection and safe fallback

Start with **Video codec: Automatic (Recommended)** and **Video decoder: Auto**.
The application and host should negotiate a mutually supported path.

| Choice | When to use it | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 | Compatibility baseline and first troubleshooting codec; SDR only | Lower resolution/FPS and bitrate |
| HEVC (H.265) | Test when Auto works; HEVC Main10 is required for the HEVC HDR path | Disable HDR, return to Auto, then H.264 |
| AV1 (Experimental) | Test only with Apollo/Sunshine and a host encoder that advertises AV1 | Return to Auto, then HEVC or H.264 |

Moonlight documents that AV1 requires Sunshine and a supported host GPU
([Moonlight PC features][moonlight-qt]). The Vibertemis package probe only confirms
that its FFmpeg decoders publish VAAPI and Vulkan configurations. It does **not**
create a device, decode a frame, prove hardware acceleration on Steam Deck, or
prove that the host can encode the codec. Confirm the selected codec in the
statistics overlay and confirm lines such as `Using Vulkan video decoding` or a
selected VAAPI path in the Vibertemis log before recording a hardware result.

If a stream fails to start, shows corruption, or falls back to slow software
decoding, retest in this order: SDR, Auto codec/decoder, H.264, 1280x720 at 30
FPS, and a lower bitrate. Change one item at a time.

## OLED HDR prerequisites and calibration boundary

Only mark OLED HDR as passed when the complete path is HDR-capable:

- Steam Deck OLED, or an HDR-capable external display;
- Gaming Mode/Gamescope with HDR enabled for the Vibertemis shortcut;
- an HDR-capable host display or EDID/virtual display;
- host HEVC Main10 or AV1 Main10 encoding support;
- a usable 10-bit client decode and Vulkan presentation path; and
- matching host/client resolution to avoid scaling artifacts.

Moonlight's [HDR requirements][moonlight-setup] describe the host display/EDID,
Main10, and resolution-matching requirements. Moonlight's Linux/Steam Deck HDR
support is implemented through the Vulkan renderer ([release notes][moonlight-releases]).
Those upstream capabilities do not prove this Vibertemis bundle works on a Deck.

Vibertemis transports and presents the HDR stream; it does not calibrate the host,
game, Deck panel, TV, dock, or cable. Use SteamOS/display and in-game calibration
controls with a known HDR test scene. Record clipping, raised blacks, banding,
washed-out color, or unexpected SDR tone mapping as failures rather than
publishing a universal brightness value. Treat Desktop Mode HDR as exploratory,
not a passed requirement; use Desktop Mode SDR as the supported comparison.

## Frame pacing and latency

- **V-Sync + Frame pacing:** best first choice for consistent motion. Early
  frames may wait in the queue, trading some latency for smoother cadence.
- **V-Sync on, Frame pacing off:** keeps tear-free presentation but removes the
  extra pacing delay; compare when queue delay or periodic stutter is high.
- **V-Sync off:** lowest presentation latency, but visible tearing may occur;
  compositor behavior such as Gamescope can affect the result. Vibertemis disables
  the frame-pacing control when V-Sync is off.

Test one setting at a time in a repeatable moving scene. At 60, 90, and 59.94
FPS, one frame interval is about 16.67 ms, 11.11 ms, and 16.68 ms respectively.
A stable frame queue delay below one interval is a useful target, not a guarantee.
The statistics do not include every compositor, display, or input delay; Moonlight
documents that boundary in its [statistics FAQ][moonlight-faq].

## Network and bitrate

Follow Moonlight's supported baseline: wire the host PC to the router; use
Ethernet for a docked Deck when practical, otherwise use a strong 5 GHz Wi-Fi 5
or 5/6 GHz Wi-Fi 6/6E connection ([setup guide][moonlight-setup]). Avoid 2.4 GHz
Wi-Fi and powerline links for acceptance testing.

Start with Vibertemis's default bitrate for the selected resolution and FPS. Raise
it only after the overlay remains stable; lower it first when network drops,
jitter, or latency rises. There is no single correct bitrate for every AP,
distance, display mode, or scene. For Internet streaming, Moonlight recommends a
bitrate at least 1 Mbps below the measured host upload capacity
([FAQ][moonlight-faq]). Its [troubleshooting guide][moonlight-troubleshooting]
also recommends lowering bitrate to distinguish bandwidth trouble.

## Read the statistics overlay

Enable it in Settings or while streaming with
`Select + L1 + R1 + X` (keyboard: `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S`). The quick menu is
`Select + L1 + R1 + Y`.

| Field | What to look for |
| --- | --- |
| Video stream | Requested resolution/rate and negotiated H.264, HEVC, or AV1 variant |
| Incoming / decoding / rendering FPS | Similar values during moving content; a static Sunshine scene may legitimately send fewer frames |
| Host processing latency | Host capture/encode contribution; investigate the host if it spikes while network values stay stable |
| Network drops | Very close to 0%; sustained loss points to link capacity or reliability |
| Jitter drops | Late/irregular arrival; check Wi-Fi contention and mismatched pacing before blaming decode |
| Network latency and variance | Stable is more useful than one isolated low sample |
| Decoding time | Compare with the frame interval; large or unstable values warrant codec/decoder fallback testing |
| Frame queue delay | Waiting after decode, commonly from pacing/V-Sync; normally below one frame interval |
| Rendering time | Includes monitor V-Sync wait, so V-Sync can add roughly one refresh interval |

Moonlight defines these fields and caveats in the [statistics FAQ][moonlight-faq].

## Troubleshooting and useful logs

Before reporting a problem, update SteamOS, restart the Deck, reproduce once in
Gaming Mode and once in Desktop Mode SDR, and capture:

- Deck model, SteamOS version, mode (Gaming/Desktop), handheld/docked, and
  external display/dock/cable details;
- Vibertemis bundle filename and `flatpak info com.artemisdesktop.ArtemisDesktopDev`;
- host software/version, GPU/driver, physical or Apollo virtual display mode;
- requested resolution, exact refresh/FPS, bitrate, codec/decoder, renderer,
  V-Sync/frame pacing, and HDR state;
- a statistics-overlay screenshot during motion; and
- the Vibertemis log from the same reproduction.

On Linux, Vibertemis writes diagnostic output to standard error. Capture it from a
Desktop Mode terminal without adding sandbox permissions:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/vibertemis-logs"
set -o pipefail
flatpak run com.artemisdesktop.ArtemisDesktopDev 2>&1 \
  | tee "$HOME/vibertemis-logs/vibertemis-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log"
```

Reproduce the issue, then quit Vibertemis. `pipefail` preserves a non-zero Vibertemis
exit status instead of hiding it behind a successful `tee`. Attach the newest
file from `~/vibertemis-logs/`. Review logs before sharing because they can contain
hostnames, IP addresses, application names, and other local details.

## What CI verifies—and what it cannot

When the Flatpak CI job is green, it verifies these software contracts:

- the tracked manifest parses, required sources are pinned, and the application
  ID/desktop/AppStream metadata agree;
- the bundle contains the internal `Artemis` compatibility executable and
  required shared libraries;
- FFmpeg's H.264, HEVC, and AV1 decoders expose the required VAAPI/Vulkan
  configuration entries;
- the application survives a bounded headless startup check; and
- fractional input parsing, including `59.94`, is covered by automated tests.

CI does **not** verify a real VAAPI/Vulkan device, decoded hardware frames,
Gamescope launch or mode switching, LCD/OLED output, HDR metadata or calibration,
latency, gamepad navigation, suspend/resume, or network-loss recovery. Only the
matrix below may support those claims.

## Hardware acceptance matrix

Record the bundle commit, SteamOS version, host details, selected settings,
overlay screenshot, and log for each row. `Not run` is the honest default; use
`Pass`, `Fail (<issue>)`, or `Blocked (<reason>)` only after a real-Deck run.

### Display, mode, and codec coverage

| ID | Deck / mode | Display | Codec / range | Rate | Expected evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | LCD / Gaming | Handheld 1280x800 | H.264 SDR | 60 | Launch, correct overlay mode, stable 10-minute moving stream | Not run |
| D2 | LCD / Desktop | Handheld 1280x800 | HEVC SDR | 60 | Launch, input, codec and decode path logged | Not run |
| D3 | LCD / Gaming | Docked, matched native mode | AV1 SDR | 59.94 | Exact client/host rate; clean fallback if AV1 is unavailable | Not run |
| D4 | LCD / Desktop | Docked, matched native mode | H.264 SDR | 60 | Window/fullscreen, external input/audio, clean exit | Not run |
| D5 | OLED / Gaming | Handheld 1280x800 | H.264 SDR | 60 | SDR baseline and overlay cadence | Not run |
| D6 | OLED / Gaming | Handheld 1280x800 | HEVC Main10 HDR | 90 | HDR mode, no clipping/washed color, decode/presentation path logged | Not run |
| D7 | OLED / Gaming | Handheld 1280x800 | AV1 SDR, then AV1 Main10 HDR if advertised | 90 | Negotiated codec/range and safe fallback recorded separately | Not run |
| D8 | OLED / Gaming | Docked HDR display, matched mode | HEVC Main10 HDR | 59.94 | End-to-end HDR and exact host/client rate | Not run |
| D9 | OLED / Desktop | Handheld 1280x800 | HEVC SDR | 90 | SDR launch/input comparison; no Desktop HDR claim | Not run |
| D10 | OLED / Desktop | Docked, matched native mode | AV1 SDR | 60 or display maximum | Codec/decode path, cadence, window/fullscreen | Not run |

Where the display exposes all three rates, repeat a moving-scene cadence check at
60, 90 (OLED or capable external display only), and 59.94 Hz. Never mark an
unsupported panel/display rate as failed; record it as blocked with its mode list.

### Interaction and recovery coverage

| ID | Applies to | Procedure | Pass condition | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | LCD + OLED, Gaming + Desktop | Navigate PC/app/settings UI using only Deck controls; open/close quick menu and stats overlay | Focus remains visible; controls and both overlays respond | Not run |
| R2 | LCD + OLED, handheld + docked | Suspend for 30 seconds during a stream, then resume | No Deck lockup; session resumes or terminates clearly and a new stream starts | Not run |
| R3 | LCD + OLED, Wi-Fi | Disable Wi-Fi for 10 seconds during a stream, then restore it | No application/Deck crash; failure is clear and reconnect succeeds | Not run |
| R4 | LCD + OLED, Gaming + Desktop | Quit and relaunch after R2/R3 | Controller, display mode, pairing, and settings remain usable | Not run |
| R5 | OLED Gaming HDR, handheld + docked | Repeat R2/R3 while HDR is active | Recovery or clean termination without stuck HDR/blank display | Not run |

## Known limitations

- This single-file development bundle has no Flatpak repository update
  channel. Its in-app updater downloads and verifies the whole bundle, then
  requires explicit Desktop Mode confirmation in Discover or Konsole.
- AV1 presence in the package is not evidence of Steam Deck hardware decode or
  host encode support.
- HDR is experimental and requires an end-to-end compatible path; LCD handheld
  is SDR, and docked HDR depends on the external display, dock, and cable.
- Apollo/Windows/display drivers can round or reject fractional modes. Verify the
  actual host mode instead of trusting the requested value.
- Gaming Mode and Desktop Mode use different presentation environments; a pass
  in one does not imply a pass in the other.
- Suspend/resume and transient network recovery may terminate a session. A clear
  failure followed by a successful reconnect is acceptable; a lockup is not.
